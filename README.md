## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The project aims to replicate the premium feel of Apple's official marketing pages. This is achieved through:

- **Consistent spacing**: Generous white space to let components breathe.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Content**: GSAP-powered reveals that engage the user as they scroll.
